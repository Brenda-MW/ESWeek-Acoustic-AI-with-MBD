# Deploy Acoustic-Based Predictive AI for Machine Health using Model-Based Design Tools

What if machines could talk? What if the hums and thrums of motors, pumps, and conveyors could speak up when trouble brews? Acoustic-based diagnostic techniques allow us to ”listen” to machines and train AI models to interpret the ”voice”, turning the complex sounds they make into actionable insights.

In this hands-on tutorial, we introduce a methodology for developing and deploying predictive AI algorithms for machine health monitoring
using acoustic signals. Participants will learn to train machine learning models that can interpret complex sensor data, effectively filtering out background noise to accurately predict machinery conditions. This approach leverages the MBD
tool suite to create, test, and implement algorithms tailored for embedded systems, emphasizing the importance of developing
small, efficient network architectures that can perform complex tasks with minimal computational resources. Participants will
acquire the skills to navigate the entire workflow, from data processing, model training to code generation and deployment
optimization, enabling the practical application of AI in predictive maintenance and machine health management.
